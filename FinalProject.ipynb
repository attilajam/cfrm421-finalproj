    "# Predicting closing price movements of NASDAQ stocks\n",
    "Attila Jamilov, Cooper Reynolds, Yueying Du, Brandon Leong, Josephine Welin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last minutes of the market being open, many stocks see heightened volatility as well as big price fluctuation. NASDAQ stock exchange uses the NASDAQ Closing Cross auction to determine the official closing prices for various assets on their exchange. We want to evaluate the performance of multiple models that we learned in class and not, on predicting this closing price movement using the dataset provided in the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close/overview), and see what models performs best, and what features we can engineer to improve on the performance of the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "We evaluate how well different machine learning algorithms can predict stock price movement near the market close. Our specific target is the change in the *market clearing price* during the NASDAQ Closing Cross.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Overview\n",
    "Each row represents auction-related market activity for a given stock on a given day. For our features, we will try using only the features provided in the dataset, then creating our own original features, trying features that the Kaggle competitors had success with, and finally a compilation of all features. Then, we will select only the most helpful features, and then test our best model on the test data set through the Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Models and Algorithms\n",
    "For our models, we will begin with Linear Regression (Josephine), Random Forest (Brandon), LightGBM and CNN (Yueying), XGBoost (Cooper), and finally we will look into Catboost (Attila), a model developed by Yandex which the winner of the Kaggle used for his approach to this Kaggle. We compare all of these models using mean average error. "

This showcases the importance of selecting the right model combined with proper feature engineering. If we continued to develop more features and pick which subsets of features worked best we would be able to get good results. Unfortunately we were hit with a time limitation, as the Kaggle ran for over 6 months, while we only had realistically one week."

    "\n",
    "While our results with our current feature engineering and models have promising results, there a clear areas that we can optimize and refine upon to enhance performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Handling Missing Data\n",
    "We could improve upon how we handle the NaN rows of far_price and near_price. As a human, we know that this means that the orders did not fill for the auction, but the models have no way to tell. If we were to find some way to put this in a feature, it might improve the results of the model. Rather than simply dropping the values, creating an indicator to flag for missing migth help with providing better signals over masking patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Expanded feature Engineering\n",
    "Another area of improvement would be like previously mentioned, picking the best features and forgetting about other ones that worsen or elongate training time. The winning solution had hundreds of features, and going through each feature to determine the most important and relevant ones could increase accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "We could also try hyper parameter tuning the other models, as fine tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, tree depth, number of estimators, regularization terms, and subsampling ratios can lead to significant gains and maybe a different model would rise to have the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Outside Kaggle Competition\n",
    "While in regards to the competition, we were supposed to only use the single dataset we were given if we were to continue to refine the model outside of it for real world applicatino, linking external data might help add additional context such as interest rates, CPI, or even news sentiment. Additionally, using other scoring methods such as time series cross validaiton could better reflect everchanging and sequential stock data. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these would be achievable given more time, and we would definitely see some improvement."
