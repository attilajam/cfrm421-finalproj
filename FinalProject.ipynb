    "# Predicting closing price movements of NASDAQ stocks\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last minutes of the market being open, many stocks see heightened volatility as well as big price fluctuation. NASDAQ stock exchange uses the NASDAQ Closing Cross auction to determine the official closing prices for various assets on their exchange. We want to evaluate the performance of multiple models that we learned in class and not, on predicting this closing price movement using the dataset provided in the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close/overview), and see what models performs best, and what features we can engineer to improve on the performance of the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our features, we will try using only the features provided in the dataset, then creating our own original features, trying features that the Kaggle competitors had success with, and finally a compilation of all features. Then, we will select only the most helpful features, and then test our best model on the test data set through the Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our models, we will begin with Linear Regression (Josephine), Random Forest (Brandon), LightGBM and CNN (Yueying), XGBoost (Cooper), and finally we will look into Catboost (Attila), a model developed by Yandex which the winner of the Kaggle used for his approach to this Kaggle.\n",
